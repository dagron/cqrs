Command bus
===========

The command bus is designed to handle commands. It's a
[publishâ€“subscribe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern) pattern.

You can use `HandlerLocatedCommandBus`. This bus use `CommandHandlerLocator` for search the handler for specific
command.

```php
use GpsLab\Component\Command\Bus\HandlerLocatedCommandBus;
use GpsLab\Component\Command\Handler\Locator\DirectBindingCommandHandlerLocator;

$locator = new DirectBindingCommandHandlerLocator();
$bus = new HandlerLocatedCommandBus($locator);

$command = new RenameArticleCommand();
$command->new_name = $new_name;

$bus->handle($command);
```

You can create custom bus implementing the interface `CommandBus`.
